# Arduino-Uno

This code explains the task of a device, that I designed and programmed with my innovation. 
The task is pulling laser cable up from a big pully to a small one.

The smaller one belongs to the client.  the user types some information such as length of the cable, type of the cable( it is a variety of sizes), etc.  According to user input, the program calculates all mathematics stuff then the device starts to pull up cable clearly and precisely from big pully to small one.

The code is in German language.
